This project is my first Data Science/ Machine Learning Project. The data comes from a public collaboration between The Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation and Spring Science. The aim of the project is to explore whether cytokine responses could be predicted from embeddings of microscopic images of cells, and investigate the best feature selection method to reduce the embedding space before training a model to make those predictions. Please read the report (pdf) for a more detailed description of the work.
